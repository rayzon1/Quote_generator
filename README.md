# Quote_generator
Quote generator project.
by. Gerardo Keys

For my first project I have chosen to create a single page application which will obtain different quotes randomly from a
list of obtained inspirational quotes. 

The user will need to click on the button with text labeled "Click here for quotes". When clicked the page will display a 
random quote chosen by the script. 

My goal for this first project was to get comfortable with basic javascript functions and DOM manipulation.
